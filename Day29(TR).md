# My Day-29 Summary of Day (SOD)

Today, I made significant progress on my college project, the sportsMeetAPP.

## Progress 🧑‍💻🧑‍💻
- Started working on the project in the afternoon at 10:00 AM.
- Created a detailed Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.
- Writing the SRS turned out to be more challenging than expected. Researched extensively on Google to understand how an SRS should be structured for a website.
- After gathering enough information, I successfully completed the SRS.
- Started working on the backend and implemented routes for login, signup, email verification, and forgot password functionalities.
- Deployed the backend on Render for testing and development.

## Tracked Time: 10 hours and 55 minutes

## EOD (End of Day)
* Completed the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document ✅
* Implemented routes for login and signup functionalities ✅
* Deployed the backend on Render for testing ✅

Overall, it was a productive day, and I accomplished the planned tasks successfully. Looking forward to continuing the development and making more progress tomorrow.
