# My Day-11 SOD

Today, I had to complete my project at any cost.

## Progress 🧑‍💻🧑‍💻
- In the afternoon, I started my work at 10:00 AM.
- I resolved some bugs on my site and updated the link for password reset requests between the backend and frontend.
- After that, I deployed my frontend on Render using the CLI in VSCode.
- Then I took a break because I had been working continuously for several hours.
- Now my site is running at https://sidhucoachingcenter.vercel.app 💪💪💪.
- My backend was already running on Render.
- I want to mention that I learned a lot from this project, especially about how Next.js works since this was my first Next.js project. I am very thankful to my brother, Mr.Sanchit Khera 😎, who was always ready to help me with my project.
- I faced a lot of problems during this project, but my dedication and patience helped me complete it.

## Tracked time: 8 hours and 11 minutes

## EOD
Overall, I have successfully completed my project and deployed it on Vercel.
