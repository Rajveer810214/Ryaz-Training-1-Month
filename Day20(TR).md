# My Day-20 SOD

Today, I continue my project in next js. The project is to clone the instragram App.

## Progress 🧑‍💻🧑‍💻
- In the afternoon, I started my work at 10:00 AM.
- In the previous day i setup the backend api of saving images in mongodb. In this way i have to create a upload folder but it works fine but when i deploy my backend on the render then i face difficulty to add a image because my backend repostiory on github then how i add dynamically image to github.
- Then i learn about what is buffer and how i can use instead of directly saving the image url in the mongodb.
- Then i create a backend api in which i save the image as buffer.
- To face alot of error while using a buffer but at the end i successfully saved the images as buffer in the mongodb.



## Tracked time: 6 hours and 14 minutes

## EOD
Overall, it was a productive day of learning.
