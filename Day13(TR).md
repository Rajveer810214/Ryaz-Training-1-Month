# My Day-13 SOD

Today, I worked on a new project in React that involves developing an editor to convert text to Markdown.

## Progress 🧑‍💻🧑‍💻
- In the afternoon, I started my work at 10:00 AM.
- Firstly, I researched reveal.js/markdown.
- After that, I found some React libraries that can assist me in converting text to Markdown.
- Then, I took a break because I had been working continuously for several hours.
- Before diving into the project, I decided to create a prototype to plan out the structure of my site.

## Tracked time: 5 hours and 11 minutes

## EOD
Overall, I learned a lot of new things today.
