# My Day-17 SOD

Today, I worked on a new project in React that involves the development of an editor to convert text to Markdown.

## Progress 🧑‍💻🧑‍💻
- In the afternoon, I started my work at 10:00 AM.
- I started working on react library that is react-slick.
- It is arduous for me how i can use this.
- Then i use react-slick documentation and also stack overflow to solve some of my errors to develop this functionality.
- I worked for several hours then i took a break.
- Then i again started working on this  then i finally develop this funtionlity in my project.
