# My Today's SOD Is ðŸ“‘
- Learn about state-management and implement it in SportsMeet2024 app.
- Fixed some bugs and did the styling in previous pages.

## Progress ðŸ’ª
- I started working at 5:50 AM, and I didn't ever work on state-management yet, so today I started with learning more about states.
- I know some tools that are useful in state-management like Zustand, Jotai, Easy-Peasy.
- I like the Jotai state-management, but I didn't know how to implement it correctly, so I did some research on Jotai.
- Worked till 8:00 AM.

- Then I started again at 12:00 PM,
- As I didn't find any good resources for Jotai, we shifted towards Easy-Peasy after discussing with other team members.
- Easy-Peasy is something that I found less complex than Jotai, and their documentation is good enough.
- I am really upset with the errors of TypeScript for Easy-Peasy; it takes so much of my time.
- Worked till 4:30 PM, then I took a break.

- Started working again at 8:45 PM.
- Finally added the Store and States in various parts of Auth pages.
- Fixed some bugs in the backend and frontend.
- Worked till 11:00 PM.

- Learned about state-management in Reactjs.
- Explored Jotai & Easy-Peasy.
- Successfully added state-management Easy-Peasy in SportsMeet2024.
- Fixed some bugs from previous pages.
- I Worked For 8:55 Hours Today Exploring And Building With Riaz âŒ›
