# My Today Day-7 SOD

I am developing a project in Next.js.

## Progress 🧑‍💻🧑‍💻
- Today, I continued working on my project in the afternoon.
- First, I set up some of the pending backend routes.
- I encountered several errors but managed to resolve most of them. However, I still have 3 to 4 ESLint errors that I'm unsure how to fix.
- I then connected the frontend with the backend, but there are still some pending tasks. I anticipate completing them tomorrow.

Tracked time: 6 hours and 15 minutes

## EOD
Overall, it was a productive day of learning, and I'm excited to continue working on my project.
