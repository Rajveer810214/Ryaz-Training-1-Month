## Progress ðŸ’ª

- Encountered some problems while building these pages.
- We Signup the User in 4 steps:
  1. Create Account
  2. Verification
  3. Login
  4. Academic Details
  If a user successfully fills all the information, only then he/she is able to select sports in which he/she wants to participate.
- Academic details contain fields like URN, Course, Branch, Year.
