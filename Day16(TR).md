# My Day-16 SOD

Today, I worked on a new project in React that involves the development of an editor to convert text to Markdown.

## Progress 🧑‍💻🧑‍💻
- In the afternoon, I started my work at 10:00 AM.
- Firstly, I created a React app and developed an interface where users can write their text and view the output in real-time.
- Then, I added additional functionalities to enhance the project like sliding functionality and download etc.
- I face alot of problems but i resolved all the problems one by one.
- But i also want to add one funtionality that is presenting slides. This is very tough for me but i know i can do this.
- THen i researched it on google then i get to know about many libraries in react and in that i use react-slick. But the funtionality of this i will develop tomorrow.

## Tracked time: 8 hours and 22 minutes

## EOD
Overall, I had a productive day and learned many new things.
