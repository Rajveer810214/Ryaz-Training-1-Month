# My Day-8 SOD

Today, I worked on my project in Next.js.

## Progress 🧑‍💻🧑‍💻
- In the afternoon, I continued working on my project.
- Firstly, I connected the frontend with the backend.
- I encountered several errors but managed to resolve most of them. However, I still have 3 to 4 ESLint errors that I'm unsure how to fix.
- Only deploying is pending.

## Tracked time: 7 hours and 15 minutes

## EOD
Overall, it was a productive day of learning.
